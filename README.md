# 60 Days Of Udacity (Secure & Private AI)

As part of the 60 Days of Udacity initiative, I will post an update everyday on my progress in learning DL/CV/course content and/or in doing related projects.

Late update (Sep 12, 2023): The update streak was cut short as I began my enrollment in college.
It's a shame that this project did not live up to its name (much like some of my other projects that went into indefinite hiatus), but I decided that my top priority was to adapt to the new environment and to do my best in my courses.
There would be no further update on this repo, but it will stay here as a record of some of my past works.
